# linter-hlint

This package will lint your opened Haskell in Atom, using [hlint](http://community.haskell.org/~ndm/hlint/).

## Installation

** Note: I havent published this to the Atom Repository yet.  The installation only works after I do that **

* Install [hlint](http://community.haskell.org/~ndm/darcs/hlint/hlint.htm#installation).
* `$ apm install linter` (if you don't have [AtomLinter/Linter](https://github.com/AtomLinter/Linter) installed).
* `$ apm install linter-hlint`
* specify the path to hlint in the settings.  You can find the path by using "which hlint" in the terminal
